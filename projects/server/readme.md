# Server

The server is the an `express` REST application, using `Sequelize` as an ORM.

## Getting Started

Get started by installing the client's dependencies; this requires `node>=12` and `npm`. `npm` is usually installed with node.

Run `npm install` inside the clients directory, then you can start the development server with `npm start`. This will start the nextjs development server on port 3000.

## Dependencies

This server uses Scryfall as the source of images and (currently) a SQLite MTGJSON for card data.
